# IBM Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project

SpaceX's Falcon 9 data collection with API&Web Scraping, Data Wrangling, EDA with SQL&Visualization, Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium&Plotly Dash and machine learning model development for IBM Data Science Capstone Project.

## Overview

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.
